## Day 0: July 06, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Learned about word embedding for sequence models on [Coursera](www.coursera.org), such as Word2Vec, negative sampling, GloVe word vectors and sentiment classification.

**Thoughts:** It is interesting to know about how the word embedding algorithms are simplified over time while still being able to achieve very good results. Being simpler in this case gets even better performance.

**Link to work:** None
