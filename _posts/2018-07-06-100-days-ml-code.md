Here I pledge to dedicate 1 hour to coding or learning Machine Learning for the next 100 days!
## Day 0: July 06, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Learned about word embedding for sequence models on [Coursera](www.coursera.org), such as Word2Vec, negative sampling, GloVe word vectors and sentiment classification.

**Thoughts:** It is interesting to know about how the word embedding algorithms are simplified over time while still being able to achieve very good results. Being simpler in this case gets even better performance.

**Link to work:** None 

## Day 1: July 07, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 
* Learned basics and intuitions about Singular Vector Decomposition(SVD). Here are two very good videos explaining it:
    * [How to do Singular Value Decomposition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfZsEFhHcNM): step for step explanation.
    * [Dimensionality Reduction: Singular Value Decomposition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5mlg91as1c): intuitive practical example.

**Thoughts:** None
