### Problem 
Network card `RTL8111/8168/8411` is not recognized with kernel `4.4.39-rt50`. 
Running `ifconfig` shows only the other network interface and `lo`.

### Solution 
It turns out the realtime kernel does not have model `r8168`. Instead it contains `r8169`.
However, by installing `r8168-dkms` the `r8169` module is automatically blacklisted. This can
be fixed by 

```
sudo apt remove r8168-dkms
sudo rm /etc/modprobe.d/r8168-dkms.conf
```
